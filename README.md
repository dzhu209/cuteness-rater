# cuteness-rater

This is my capstone project for The Data Incubator - Data Science Fellowship prorgam. In this project, my goal is to create an App/Web that allows users to upload a pet photo, rates the pet photo’s cuteness, and provides recommendation to increase page views.

In the united states, every year, 6.5 million dogs, cats, and other former pets are abandoned or lost and enter shelters. But only half of them are adopted and many are returned to the shelters again after less than a year of finding a new home. 

So this project aims to help shelters to attract more potential adopters and improve their adoption rates. By How? I focus on the pet profile picture because most people will first go to the shelter’s website and browse the photos of available pets. If the photos are attractive enough, then they will visit the shelter in-person. This means a picture is very important and it even can save lives. However, most shelter didn’t have the money and professionals to spend time on taking a great photo. So my project provides an easy tool to predict a pet photo’s popularity and provide feedback about which aspects of the photo can improve.

By using 9000+ images, I created several convolutional neural network to predict the page views. Then, I deployed the prediction model and created this cuteness rater App.

The app is available: https://cuteness-rater.streamlit.app/
